# Spring 6 REST API

## Description
This project is a simple **RESTful API** built with the **Spring 6 Framework** for learning and testing purposes. It demonstrates how to create a REST API using Spring Boot, with data stored in memory using a **`HashMap`**. This approach allows for quick experimentation without the need for a full database setup.

Key features:
- Built with **Spring 6** and **Spring Boot**.
- Data is stored in-memory using a **`HashMap`** (no external database required).
- Includes **Project Lombok** to reduce boilerplate code.
- Basic CRUD operations exposed via RESTful endpoints.

## Features
- **CRUD functionality**: Create, read, update, and delete resources.
- **In-memory data storage**: Uses a `HashMap` to store records temporarily.
- **Spring Boot** auto-configuration: Get up and running quickly with minimal setup.
- **Lombok** integration: Automatic getter/setter generation, reducing the need for boilerplate code.


### Prerequisites
Before you can run the project, ensure that you have the following installed:
- **Java 17** or higher
- **Maven** (for managing dependencies)
- An IDE such as **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse** (optional, but recommended)
